# GROWHT MIND SET

I would say  my biggest strengths are being available to communicate with people and customers efficiently.  Lead other team members and associates by making them feel comfortable and confident. Always being a team player and getting the job done. Always wanting to improve. Knowing that you never stop learning. 


Some of my weaknesses would be technical not knowing how to code at the current moment. I want to becoming more confident with the knowledge I gain from code fellows.  Not being so hard on myself when Iâ€™m learning something new
